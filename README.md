# rs-poker

This is my fork of [rs-poker](https://github.com/elliottneilclark/rs-poker). The primary differences between this fork and the original are that this fork
only contains the core module (with a few added features). I make use of this
library in my GTO solver (open source coming soon).

Please refer to the original documentation for any curiosities you may have.
